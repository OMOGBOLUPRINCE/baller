1  Flowers need sunshine,
Violets need dew, all angels in heaven know I need u. years may fly,
tears may dry, but my love with u will never die, I love you so much honey

2 You are the reason why I stay happy in life, Let me tag you as world’s greatest wife,
Love you lots my sweetheart, Please don’t ever part!you are my world honey 

3 You came into my life and totally changed my world. I have lost total control of myself. I am a changed person. My heart does not belong any more to me. It's given away to you. I am deeply and madly in love with you.

4 Your love gives me the power to stay,To reach my every way,
Your love is like oxygen in my life,Thanks to you my beautiful wife,
I love you!

5 Someday somehow whatever you prayed for will come true
it may not be in the exact package you wanted
but it'll be what God thinks is best for you.
Have Faith Today.

6 There are many stars but the Moon is U,
There are many friends but the Best is U,
To forget Me is up to U,
To forget U is something I’ll never do!
***Good Morning***!

7 I'm thinking of you
And wish you a great day
I want the best for you
and hope things go your way.

8 Sweet be the home where you tarry,
Light be the load that you carry.
Smooth be the road where you proceed,
Happy be the day that you foresee!

9 The Sun peeps through the curtains
And sees us wrapped
In each other’s arms.
Good Morning my Love!

10 You are the light of my world,
The music in my heart and
The first thought of my day.
Good Morning My Dear.

11 A cup of hot hello,
A plate of crispy wishes,
A spoon of sweet smiles &
A slice of great success - for u
Enjoy they day!
***Good Morning***!

12 Knock!!!Knock!!!
May I come into your world?
I bring no flowers, No cakes,
But wishes to keep you fresh,
Prayer to keep you healthy,
And love to keep you smiling…
Good Morning….

13 It makes me so happy,

Send a good morning message
right back to you,
Good Morning my Friend.
